# whatsapp-chats-analysis
This repo contains notebook for the implementation of whatsapp chat analysis.


#How To Get Started

-This implementation is done using a notebook so to run it as it is, one needs to have a Jupyter Notebook running (you can have it by installing Anaconda)

To run the Notebook:
1. Make sure you exported the Whatsapp chat that you want to analyze (you can export your chart by clicking on the 3 dots at the top right corner of the whatsapp)
2. Replace the `EXPORTED CHAT` with the name of your exported chat. Eg if the chat file name is `Chat with My Group` you then replace the `EXPORTED CHAT` with `Chat with My Group.txt`
3. Run the Notebook
4. If you get stuck you can comment here
